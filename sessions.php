  // A session in PHP, is a superglobal variable that's used to store info on a user,
  // to be used across multiple pages.
  // Once a session is created, a user is assigned a session ID.

  // Example: login credentials
  // Once a user logs into a site, such as Facebook, the user can visit different pages on
  // that site and stay logged in.
